Building Subsurface from Source
===============================

Subsurface uses quite a few open source libraries and frameworks to do its
job. The most important ones include libdivecomputer, Qt, Marble
(more precisely libmarblewidget), libxml2, libxslt, libsqlite3, libzip,
libgrantlee5 and libgit2.

Below are instructions for building Subsurface under some popular
Linux distributions, for building Subsurface using Homebrew on a Mac,
and for cross-building Subsurface for Windows. The lack of a working
package management system for Windows makes it really painful to build
Subsurface natively under Windows, so we don't support that at all.

All of the prebuilt binaries that we provide (right now Windows, Mac,
Ubuntu/Debian/LinuxMint, and openSUSE/Fedora) are built using our own
custom "flavors" of libdivecomputer and libmarblewidget. You can get
these from

git://git.subsurface-divelog.org/marble (in the Subsurface-branch branch)
git://git.subsurface-divelog.org/libdc (in the Subsurface-branch branch)

Those branches won't have a pretty history and will include ugly merges,
but they should always allow a fast forward pull that tracks what we believe
developers should build against.

In contrast to that both repositories also have Subsurface-clean branches.
These should allow distros to see which patches we have applied on top of
upstream. They will receive force pushes as we rebase to newer versions of
upstream so they are not ideal for ongoing development (but they are of
course easy to use for distributions as they always build "from scratch",
anyway).

The rationale for this is that we have no intention of forking either of
these two projects. We simply are adding a few patches on top of their
latest versions and want to do so in a manner that is both easy for our
developers who try to keep them updated frequently, and anyone packaging
Subsurface or trying to understand what we have done relative to their
respective upstreams.

At this point Qt5 is required, Qt5.4 or newer is recommended and on the
Mac, in order to get native Bluetooth support, Qt5.5 is necessary.

Similarly, in order for our cloud storage to be fully functional you need
libgit2 0.23 or newer.

Finally, as of Subsurface 4.5 we have switched our build system to cmake.
qmake based builds are no longer supported.

Build options for Subsurface
----------------------------

The following options are recognized when passed to cmake:

 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release	create a release build
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug	create a debug build

The Makefile that was created using cmake can be forced into a much more
verbose mode by calling

 make VERBOSE=1

Many more variables are support, the easiest way to interact with them is
to call

 ccmake .

in your build directory.


Building Subsurface 4.5 under Linux
-----------------------------------

On Fedora you need

sudo yum install git gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool cmake \
	libzip-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libsqlite3x-devel \
	libgit2-devel libudev-devel libusbx-devel libcurl-devel libssh2-devel\
	qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative-devel qt5-qtscript-devel \
	qt5-qtwebkit-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qttools-devel \
	qt5-qtconnectivity-devel

Note that beginning with Fedora 22, you should be using the dnf command instead
as yum is being deprecated.

Package names are sadly different on OpenSUSE

sudo zypper install git gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool cmake libzip-devel \
	libxml2-devel libxslt-devel sqlite3-devel libgit2-devel libusb-1_0-devel \
	libqt5-linguist-devel libqt5-qttools-devel libQt5WebKitWidgets-devel \
	libqt5-qtbase-devel libQt5WebKit5-devel libqt5-qtsvg-devel \
	libqt5-qtscript-devel libqt5-qtdeclarative-devel \
	libqt5-qtconnectivity-devel

On Debian Jessie and recent Ubuntu flavors this seems to work

sudo apt-get install git g++ make autoconf libtool cmake pkg-config \
	libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libzip-dev libsqlite3-dev \
	libusb-1.0-0-dev libgit2-dev \
	qt5-default qt5-qmake qtchooser qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev \
	libqt5webkit5-dev libqt5qml5 libqt5quick5 libqt5declarative5 \
	qtscript5-dev libssh2-1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev qttools5-dev \
	qtconnectivity5-dev

On PCLinuxOS you appear to need the following packages

su -c "apt-get install -y autoconf automake cmake libtool gcc-c++ git \
lib64usb1.0-devel lib64zip-devel lib64qt5webkitwidgets-devel qttools5 \
qttranslations5 lib64qt5xml-devel lib64qt5test-devel lib64qtscript-devel \
lib64qt5svg-devel lib64qt5concurrent-devel lib64qt5bluetooth-devel"

In order to build Subsurface, use the supplied build script. This should
work on most systems that have all the prerequisite packages installed.

You should have Subsurface sources checked out in a sane place, something
like this:

mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone git://subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface
./subsurface/scripts/build.sh # <- this step will take quite a while as it
                              #    compiles a handful of libraries before
			      #    building Subsurface

Now you can run Subsurface like this:

cd ~/src/subsurface/build
./subsurface


Note: on many Linux versions (for example on Kubuntu 15.04) the user must
belong to the dialout group.

You may need to run something like

sudo usermod -a -G dialout username

with your correct username and log out and log in again for that to take
effect.

If you get errors like:

./subsurface: error while loading shared libraries: libGrantlee_Templates.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You can run the following command:

sudo ldconfig ~/src/install-root/lib


Building Subsurface under MacOSX (using Homebrew)
-------------------------------------------------

0) You need to have XCode installed. The first time (and possibly after updating OSX)
you need to run

$ xcode-select --install

1)  Install Homebrew

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2) Install needed dependencies

$ brew install asciidoc libzip sqlite cmake libusb pkg-config automake libtool hidapi

3) Make the brew version of sqlite the default

$ brew link --force sqlite

4) Download and install Qt

You can build Qt from source or use the prebuilt binaries for Mac. Start
by downloading the online installer:

$ curl -L -o ~/Downloads/qt-unified-mac-x64-online.dmg \
	http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-mac-x64-online.dmg
$ open ~/Downloads/qt-unified-mac-x64-online.dmg

Double click on the Qt installer shown in the Finder window.

In the installer, chose an install folder (the build script we are using
below assumes that you accept the default of /home/<your username>/Qt), in
"Select components" select the most recent version and (if you want to
build Qt from source) be sure you also install the "Source Components".
To save time and disk space you can unselect Android and IOS packages
as well as QtWebEngine, Qt3D, Qt Canvas 3D and the Qt Extras.

If you want to build from source (which takes a very long time and a lot of disk)

$ cd ~/Qt/5.5/Src/

$ ./configure -prefix /usr/local -opensource

$ make -j4

$ make install

5) run the build script

cd ~/src
bash subsurface/scripts/build.sh

After the above is done, Subsurface.app will be available in the
subsurface/build directory. You can run Subsurface with the command

$ open subsurface/build/Subsurface.app

or you can move this folder to /Applications to install Subsurface for
every user.


Cross-building Subsurface on Linux for Windows
----------------------------------------------

Subsurface builds nicely with MinGW - the official builds are done as
cross builds under Linux (currently on Ubuntu 14.04). A shell script to do
that (plus the .nsi file to create the installer with makensis) are
included in the packaging/windows directory.

Please read through the explanations and instructions in
packaging/windows/mxe-based-build.sh if you want to build the Windows
version on your Linux system.


Building Subsurface on Windows
------------------------------

This is NOT RECOMMENDED. To the best of our knowledge there is one single
person who regularly does this. The Subsurface team does not provide support
for Windows binary build from sources natively under Windows...


Building Subsurface for Android
-------------------------------

To compile the mobile version you will need:

-Qt for Android (this can be downloaded from: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
-Android SDK
-Android NDK

In the packaging/android folder, open the build.sh file and add the paths to the SDK,
NDK and Qt for android at the top.

After that, you can run: ./subsurface/packaging/android/build.sh

This will generate an apk file in ./subsurface-mobile-build-arm/bin
