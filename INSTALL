Building Subsurface from Source
===============================

Subsurface uses a few open source libraries and frameworks to do its
job. The most important ones include libdivecomputer, Qt, Marble
(more precisely libmarblewidget), libxml2, libxslt, libsqlite3, libzip,
and libgit2.

Below are instructions for building Subsurface under some popular
Linux distributions, for building Subsurface using Homebrew on a Mac,
and for cross-building Subsurface for Windows. The lack of a working
package management system for Windows makes it really painful to build
Subsurface natively under Windows, so we don't support that at all.

All of the prebuilt binaries that we provide (right now Windows, Mac,
Ubuntu/Debian/LinuxMint, and openSUSE/Fedora) are built using our own
custom "flavors" of libdivecomputer and libmarblewidget. You can get
these from

git://git.subsurface-divelog.org/marble (in the Subsurface-4.4 branch)
git://git.subsurface-divelog.org/libdc (in the Subsurface-4.4 branch)

Both of these repositories also have a Subsurface-testing branch. That
branch is explicitly marked as NOT STABLE and will receive force pushes.
The rationale for this is that we have no intention of forking either of
these two projects. We simply are adding a few patches on top of their
latest versions and so those testing branches get frequently rebased.

Also, all of the prebuilt binaries (with the exception of the Ubuntu 12.04
build) are now Qt5 based and Qt5 is considered the stable and supported
framework to use for building Subsurface. The sources contain a best
effort patch in packaging/ubuntu/0001-Make-build-with-Qt4.patch that
attempts to continue to allow building with Qt4, but that is not
officially supported and will result in missing functionality.

As of Subsurface 4.5 we are switching our build system to cmake. qmake
based builds are no longer supported.

Build options for Subsurface
----------------------------

The following options are recognized when passed to cmake:

 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release	create a release build
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug	create a debug build

The Makefile that was created using cmake can be forced into a much more
verbose mode by calling

 make VERBOSE=1

Building Subsurface 4 under Linux
---------------------------------

On Fedora you need

sudo yum install git gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool cmake \
	libzip-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libsqlite3x-devel \
	libgit2-devel libudev-devel libusbx-devel \
	qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative-devel qt5-qtscript-devel \
	qt5-qtwebkit-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qttools-devel qt5-qtlocation-devel

Note that beginning with Fedora 22, you should be using the dnf command instead
as yum is being deprecated.

Package names are sadly different on OpenSUSE

sudo zypper install git gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool cmake libzip-devel \
	libxml2-devel libxslt-devel sqlite3-devel libgit2-devel libusb-1_0-devel \
	libqt5-linguist-devel libqt5-qttools-devel libQt5WebKitWidgets-devel \
	libqt5-qtbase-devel libQt5WebKit5-devel libqt5-qtsvg-devel \
	libqt5-qtscript-devel libqt5-qtdeclarative-devel

On Debian Jessie this seems to work

sudo apt-get install git g++ make autoconf libtool cmake pkg-config \
	libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libzip-dev libsqlite3-dev \
	libusb-1.0-0-dev libgit2-dev \
	qt5-default qt5-qmake qtchooser qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev \
	libqt5webkit5-dev libqt5qml5 libqt5quick5 libqt5declarative5 \
	qtscript5-dev libssh2-1-dev qtpositioning5-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

On PCLinuxOS you appear to need the following packages

su -c "apt-get install -y autoconf automake cmake libtool gcc-c++ git \
lib64usb1.0-devel lib64zip-devel lib64qt5webkitwidgets-devel qttools5 \
qttranslations5 lib64qt5xml-devel lib64qt5test-devel lib64qtscript-devel \
lib64qt5svg-devel lib64qt5concurrent-devel"

In order to build Subsurface, use the supplied build script. This should
work on most systems that have all the prerequisite packages installed...

You should have Subsurface sources checked out in a sane place, something
like this:

mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone -b v4.4.2 git://subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface
./subsurface/scripts/build.sh # <- this step will take quite a while as it
                              #    compiles a handful of libraries before
			      #    building Subsurface

Now you can run Subsurface like this:

cd ~/src
install-root/bin/subsurface


Building Subsurface under MacOSX (using Homebrew)
-------------------------------------------------

0) You need to have XCode installed. The first time (and possibly after updating OSX)
you need to run

$ xcode-select --install

1)  Install Homebrew

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"

2) Install needed dependencies

$ brew install asciidoc libzip sqlite cmake libusb pkg-config

3) Make the brew version of sqlite the default

$ brew link --force sqlite

4) Download Qt from http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

In the installer, chose an install folder (e.g., /home/username/Qt5), in
"Select components" select the most recent version and be sure you also
install the "Source Components".

Build it (takes a long time)

$ cd ~/Qt5/5.4/Src/

$ ./configure -prefix /usr/local -opensource

$ make -j4

$ make install

5) Install custom subsurface Marble

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone -b Subsurface-4.4 git://subsurface-divelog.org/marble marble-source
$ cd marble-source
$ mkdir marble-build
$ cd marble-build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DQTONLY=TRUE \
	-DQT5BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../../marble-source
$ cd src/lib/marble
$ make -j4
$ make install

5) Install Libdivecomputer

$ brew install automake libtool
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone -b Subsurface-4.4 git://subsurface-divelog.org/libdc libdivecomputer
       # -> when not building a release version of Subsurface but the
       #    latest master, it may be necessary to build against the
       #    Subsurface-testing branch
$ cd libdivecomputer
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --disable-shared
$ make -j4
$ make install


6) Compile Subsurface

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone git://subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make -j4
$ make install

After the above is done, Subsurface.app will be available in the
subsurface/build/staging directory. This folder can then be moved
to /Applications install Subsurface for every user.



Cross-building Subsurface on Linux for Windows
----------------------------------------------

Subsurface builds nicely with MinGW - the official builds are done as
cross builds under Linux (currently on Fedora 20). A shell script to do
that (plus the .nsi file to create the installer with makensis) are
included in the packaging/windows directory.

On OpenSUSE, for mingw64 packages you should add the specific
repository from their site. After that you can run the following
command:
sudo zypper install mingw64-cross-libqt5-qttools mingw64-mpc-devel \
      mingw64-filesystem mingw64-pkg-config mingw64-cross-gcc \
      mingw64-gcc-c++ mingw64-libusb-1_0-devel \
      mingw64-cross-libqt5-qttools mingw64-libqt5-qtwebkit \
      mingw64-libqt5-qtwebkit-devel mingw64-cross-libqt5-qmake \
      mingw64-libqt5-qtscript mingw64-libqt5-qtscript-devel \
      mingw64-libqt5-qtsvg mingw64-libqt5-qtsvg-devel \
      mingw64-libqt5-qtdeclarative mingw64-libqt5-qtdeclarative-devel \
      mingw64-libssh2-devel mingw64-libzip-devel \
      mingw64-sqlite-devel mingw64-win_iconv-devel \
      mingw64-libxslt-devel mingw64-libqt5-qttools

[Observation] - Sometimes on OpenSUSE platform there is a problem with
the mingw64-libzip-devel package(the zipconf header is not installed in
the right place) and you have to create a symbolic link using the following
command:
  sudo ln -s /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/libzip/include/zipconf.h \
	     /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/zipconf.h

Everywhere below the mingw64- prefix is used for the cross tools. If you
really need a 32bit binary you need to use mingw32- as prefix and you may
also run into issues creating an installable binary with Qt5 (i.e., you
may have to go back to Qt4).

The best way to get libdivecomputer to build appears to be

$ mkdir -p ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone -b Subsurface-4.4 git://subsurface-divelog.org/libdc libdivecomputer
       # or -b Subsurface-testing to get the testing version - careful,
       #                          careful - this gets rebased and may be broken
       # -> when not building a release version of Subsurface but the
       #    latest master, it may be necessary to build against the
       #    Subsurface-testing branch

$ cd libdivecomputer
$ autoreconf --install
$ mingw64-configure --disable-shared
$ mingw64-make
$ sudo mingw64-make install

To compile Marble, use:

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone -b Subsurface-4.4 git://subsurface-divelog.org/marble marble-source
       # or -b Subsurface-testing to get the testing version - careful,
       #                          careful - this gets rebased and may be broken

$ mkdir marble-build
$ cd marble-build
$ mingw64-cmake -DQTONLY=ON -DQT5BUILD=ON \
	-DBUILD_MARBLE_APPS=OFF -DBUILD_MARBLE_EXAMPLES=OFF \
	-DBUILD_MARBLE_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_MARBLE_TOOLS=OFF \
	-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DWITH_DESIGNER_PLUGIN=OFF \
	-DBUILD_WITH_DBUS=OFF ../marble-source
$ mingw64-make # <- this step will take quite a while... if you have more cores
               #    try ming64-make -j8 or something like that
$ sudo mingw64-make install


To compile libgit2, use:

$ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 ~/src/libgit2
$ mkdir ~/src/libgit2/build
$ cd ~/src/libgit2
$ git checkout v0.21.5
$ cd build
$ mingw64-cmake ..
$ mingw64-make
$ sudo mingw64-make install

To compile Subsurface, use:

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone git://subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ cd git checkout v4.4.2   # this get's you the last release
                         # skip this step to build the latest development
			 # version
$ packagin/windows/mingw-make.sh Qt5 SPECIAL_MARBLE_PREFIX=1
$ packaging/windows/mingw-make.sh install
$ packaging/windows/mingw-make.sh installer

The last step assumes that you have a link from packaging/windows/dll to
the correct directory in your MinGW installation. On my machine that is
/usr/i686-w64-mingw64/sys-root/mingw/bin
Similarly, the paths used in packaging/windows/mingw-make.sh may need to
be adjusted according to your distributions layout

Also, at least one version of Qt DLLs shipping with Fedora was
self-inconsistent at caused random crashes at startup. Unless you have
good reasons to build your own binaries, on Windows you may be better off
with the pre-compiled binaries we provide.


Building Subsurface on Windows
------------------------------

This is NOT RECOMMENDED. To the best of our knowledge there is one single
person who regularly does this. The Subsurface team does not provide support
for Windows binary build from sources...
