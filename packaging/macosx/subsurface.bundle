       self-explanatory, while auto means that the script will try to
       figure out which icons are needed. This is done by getting all
       the strings from all copied binaries, and matching them against
       icon names. To be safe, you should use "all". "none" is useful
       if you want just the index.theme file but no icons, mostly
       needed for the "hicolor" base theme.
