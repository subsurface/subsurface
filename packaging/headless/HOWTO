This is a protocoll of my (Robert's) attempts to come up with a headless version
of Subsurface that runs on a small one chip computer like a RaspberryPi or C.H.I.P.

The idea behind this is that that computer could do the talking to the dive computer
and then provide the data (I thought the easiest way would be via being a wifi 
access point running a git server serving the user's divelog in git).

This is still very far from working and a lot more needs to be done. As this task is
mainly SysAdmin stuff on the small computer, it's hard to preserve this. So I decided 
to take a log of what I did. This is a dump of the corresponding wiki page on the old
trac system.

* Bought RPi3 with SD card.
* Downloaded Raspian Jessie from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and decompress it
* Downloaded PiFiller and run it, follow instructions there
* Give up as RPi 3 wants a micro SD card, not an SD card.
* Reinstalled on a micro SD
* Connected network cable from Laptop (enabled Internet sharing in System Preferences)
* ifconfig suggests RPi got IP address 192.168.2.2
* logged in as user pi and pw raspberry
* sudo apt-get update and dist-upgrade
* no space left on device. Hmm. Trying to reboot
* ah running sudo rasps-config allows to extend the file system
* sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
* mkdir src
* cd src
* git clone https://subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface.git
* sudo apt-get install git g++ make autoconf automake libtool cmake pkg-config \
        libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libzip-dev libsqlite3-dev \
        libusb-1.0-0-dev libgit2-dev \
        qt5-default qt5-qmake qtchooser qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev \
        libqt5webkit5-dev libqt5qml5 libqt5quick5 libqt5declarative5 \
        qtscript5-dev libssh2-1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev qttools5-dev \
        qtconnectivity5-dev  qtpositioning5-dev (qtlocation5-dev was not found)
* subsurface/scripts/build.sh
* fails to find an include file, trying export QtDir=/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/qt5
* that did not help, now trying CPATH
* Argh, of course, it's not i386-linux-gnu but arm...
* Now, it complains about qt wanting fPIC for position independent code. Setting that in CMakeText
* Ah, no, that is just for some test. The subsurface binary is already built. good.
* And it starts (after I have installed XQuartz on my Macbook)
* after initial problems (I don't know), it downloads dives from the Vytec.
* I created a new directory and do git init there and then I can save in git format
* From the laptop: git clone ssh://pi@192.168.2.2/home/pi/.subsurface/gitsave works

==RPi as wifi access point==
* sudo apt-get install hosted
* Following https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/raspberry-pi/2002171.htm
* sudo vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
* sudo chmod 600 /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
* sudo hostapd -dd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
* I see the AP but my passphrase is rejected. Now trying http://elinux.org/RPI-Wireless-Hotspot
* sudo apt-get install udhcpd
* sudo vi  /etc/udhcpd.conf
* sudo vi /etc/default/udhcpd
* once more sudo vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
* reboot
* one day later: I have to do the sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.42.1 again, but then it works. The iPhone take the connection and sees 192.168.42.1

* sudo apt-get install apache2

== Installing the command line version of subsurface ==

* cd ~/src/subsurface
* mv build build.full
* git remote add github https://github.com/atdotde/subsurface.git
* git checkout github/command_line -b command_line
* cd ~/src
* subsurface/scripts/build.sh


==BIND==
* sudo apt-get install bind9 bind9utils dnsutils
* sudo vim /etc/bind/named.conf.local
* sudo vi /etc/bind/db.example.com

==Git server on CHIP==
So far, no significant difference to the Pi

* run subsurface and save to local git repository (with [] syntax)
* cd src/subsurface/build/
* ./subsurface 
* cd cloud
*  git init
*  git checkout robert
*  sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
*  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
* git clone --bar cloud/ cloud.git
*  sudo adduser git
*  sudo mv cloud.git/ ~git
*  sudo chown git.git -R /home/git/cloud.git/
*  sudo Cash git (set it to /usr/bin/git-shell)
* a2enmod cgi alias env rewrite
* sudo mkdir /opt/git
*  sudo cp -r ~git/cloud.git/ /opt/git/
*  sudo chgrp -R www-data /opt/git
*  sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf 
*  sudo htpasswd -c /opt/git/.htpasswd subsurface
*  sudo chgrp www-data /opt/git/.htpasswd 
*  sudo apt-get install gitweb
*  sudo a2enmod env alias fcgid auth_digest
*  sudo service apache2 restart
*  sudo vi /etc/gitweb.conf 

==a new attempt==
* threw away the default site and roughly followed http://p0l0.binware.org/index.php/2011/08/26/git-over-http-git-http-backend/ (without SSL or authentication)
* /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/001-git.conf
* created /var/www/git/test.git as a repository and gave rights to www-data
* git config http.receivepack true
* this seems to work as in serves git repository clone and push
