Previous Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Subsurface-mobile_ is the mobile version of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with
extensive infrastructure to display, organize, and interpret scuba and free dives.
_Subsurface-mobile_ is available for Android and iOS. It is open-source software (in simple terms
that means that there is no commercial interest behind it, all the source code needed to build the
app is available, there are no ads, no one is monetizing your data, etc).

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows a more accessible dive log on the go. For example, you can prove dive
experience on a dive trip to dive shops or review previous dives while on a dive boat.
_Subsurface-mobile_ also allows the gathering of GPS locations where dives are performed.
Assuming you have a dive computer that is supported by the mobile OS of your choice,
_Subsurface-mobile_ even supports the downloading of dives from your dive computer.

Users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the mobile app together with the desktop version of
_Subsurface_, sharing dive information between the mobile and the desktop versions using a free
_Subsurface Cloud_ account. However, _Subsurface-mobile_ can also be used independently of the
desktop version and does not require the use of cloud storage.

_Subsurface-mobile_ 3.0 is a fairly significant rewrite of our mobile app, which we believe
justifies the jump in major version number.

== Major new features

- We completely re-implemented the dive list and as a result you should see a very noticeable
  performance improvement compared to earlier versions. As part of this rewrite, we have added a
  context menu to several screens, which gives you access to additional operations.  For example,
  you are now able to manage dive trips in the mobile app, move dives between trips, edit trip
  notes, etc.

- You can now zoom into the dive profile with a pinch gesture and pan the zoomed-in profile by
  dragging with a finger in order to better see details in the profile.

- We added an undo and redo system which makes it much easier to deal with errors or unintended
  actions that you may have taken in the mobile UI.

- For _Android_ users, we are bringing back a major feature that we used to have a partial
  implementation of: downloads from USB-serial dive computers should once again work for all Android
  devices. This means you can download dive information directly to your mobile Android device from
  most older Suunto dive computers, most Mares, Oceanic, Scubapro, etc. Actually, this new feature
  supports quite a few more dive computer families for USB serial download than what we had before,
  as now more USB serial chipsets are supported.

== Other improvements

- We restructured the menu system which is now more intuitive, bundling related topics together
  and reducing clutter.
- You can now initiate a reset of your _Subsurface Cloud_ password from within the mobile app.
- We rewrote the _Settings_ page to make it easier to use.
- You can now select the unit system that _Subsurface-mobile_ uses to display your dive data.
- We added a new _Dive summary_ which should make it easier to give a dive center a quick overview
  of your dive experience.
- We made small improvements (as a result of a complete behind-the-scenes rewrite) to the filter
  code.
- You should see various usability improvements in the UI.
- You are now able to upload dive data to divelogs.de and DiveShare.com directly from your mobile
  device.


== Bug fixes
- Several of the small oddities with the dive list in our last version should be gone; in the
  previous version sometimes after editing a dive you were shown the wrong dive; sometimes after
  larger operations like downloading from a dive computer or applying GPS fixes the dive list would
  get completely confused and you had to restart _Subsurface-mobile_ for things to work correctly
  again. Many other small improvements along those same lines.
- We made many small bug fixes in the download UI and the handling of downloaded dives.
- We fixed an issue with GPS positions that were applied to otherwise unchanged dives not being
  saved to storage.
