"_Subsurface-mobile_ is a more limited mobile version of _Subsurface_ aimed "
"at Android and iOS smartphone and tablet devices, allowing viewing, "

"larger computer is not useful. While the desktop version of _Subsurface_ "
"shows much more detailed information for each dive, the mobile version "
"allows a more accessible dive log on a dive trip, useful for proving dive "
"experience to dive shops or to review previous dives. _Subsurface-mobile_ "
