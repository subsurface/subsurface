"_CSV_ is an abbreviation for a data file format: _Comma-Separated "
"Values_. It is a file format that allows you to view or edit information "
"using a text editor like Notepad (Windows), gedit (Linux) or TextWrangler "
"(OS/X). There are two main advantages of the _CSV_ format.  First, the data "
"are easily editable as text without any proprietary software.  Second, all "
"information is human-readable, not obscured by any custom or proprietary "
"attributes that proprietary software inserts into files.  Because of its "
"simplicity the _CSV_ format is used as an interchange format between many "
"software packages, e.g. between spreadsheet, statistical, graphics, database "
"and diving software. Within _Subsurface_, _CSV_ files can also be used to "
"import information from other sources like spreadsheet-based dive logs and "
"some dive computers."

"_Subsurface_ downloads the information stored on the SDA (the built-in file "

"After selecting the above device name, download the dives from the Uemis "
"Zurich. One technical issue with the Uemis Zurich download implementation "
"(this is a Uemis firmware limitation, not a _Subsurface_ issue) is that you "
"cannot download more than about 40-50 dives without running out of memory on "
"the SDA. This will usually only happen the very first time you download "
"dives from the Uemis Zurich.  Normally when downloading at the end of a day "
"or even after a dive trip, the capacity is sufficient. If _Subsurface_ "
"displays an error that the dive computer ran out of space, the solution is "
"straightforward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and "
"reconnect it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the "
"download will continue where it stopped previously. You may have to do this "
"more than once, depending on how many dives are stored on the dive computer."
