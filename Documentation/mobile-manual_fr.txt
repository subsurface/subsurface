[big]#Subsurface-mobile pour Android: MANUEL UTILISATEUR#

*Manual author*: Willem Ferguson

toc::[]

[blue]#_Version 1.0, Mars 2016_#

Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux
(many distributions) and Android (iOS under development). In addition,
_Subsurface_ is open-source software that allows downloading dive
information from most dive computers.

Introducing Subsurface-mobile
-----------------------------

_Subsurface-mobile_ is an extension of _Subsurface_ on laptop and tabletop
computers. It runs on Android smartphone and tablet devices and is a tool
for viewing or sharing dive information at dive sites where a larger
computer is not useful. _Subsurface-mobile_ also allows the gathering of GPS
locations where dives are performed.

A version of _Subsurface-mobile_ for iOS is under development but not yet
ready for testing.

While _Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to enter and save dive information
using an Android device, users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the
mobile app as an extension of the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_.
This allows the storage of dive logs on the Internet and which can be shared
by the Android version as well as the desktop version.  While the desktop
version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information for each dive,
the mobile version allows one to have a more accessible dive log on a dive
trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to review previous
dives.

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows one to:

- Download existing dive log information from the Internet.
- View this information on an Android device.
- Edit many of the dive log data fields, e.g. divemaster, buddy, equipment or
  notes about a dive.
- Create and add new dive records to one's dive log.
- Store the updated dive log on the Internet.
- Record, store and apply GPS positions of dives.
- View the localities of recorded GPS positions and of dives on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following text.  What
_Subsurface-mobile_ does not support (at this time) is downloading dive data
directly from a dive computer. That still has to happen with _Subsurface_ on
a desktop or laptop computer. We are investigating ways to support
downloading from a subset of the supported dive computers on Android
devices, but this is not yet ready for testing.

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on an Android device

Find _Subsurface-mobile_ in the _Google Play Store_. Search for
_Subsurface-mobile_ and install it.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

Upon starting _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a Subsurface splash
screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this may take
several seconds. After loading, the _Cloud Credentials screen_ appears (see
image below).

image::mobile-images/landingscreen.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile landing screen", align="center"]

Since _Subsurface_ is largely dependent on a dive log saved on the Internet,
provide a user-ID and password for access to the _Subsurface Cloud_. These
credentials are obtained by opening the desktop version of _Subsurface_ and
by clicking _File   ->  Preferences  -> Network_, explained in detail in the
user manual for the _Subsurface_ desktop version. Once the account has
been created and verified using the desktop version one can use _Subsurface-mobile_.

When entering a password, it is possible to check a checkbox that enables
the text of the password to be shown. Checking the check box labelled
"Remember" allows _Susburface-mobile_ to keep the credentials for subsequent
logins (see image above).  Having entered the credentials, tap the disk icon
at the bottom of the screen.  _Subsurface-mobile_ attempts to download the
existing dive log from the_Subsurface_ cloud server. Appropriate messages
are shown onscreen. Finally a list of dives are shown.


== Local copy of the dive log and synchronisation with Internet

Once the dive list has been downloaded from the Internet,
_Subsurface-mobile_ keeps a local copy on the mobile device. This means
that, if there is no Internet connection at a dive site, one can still
access the local copy and view and manipulate dive information. If there is
Internet connectivity, _Subsurface-mobile_ accesses the Internet-based dive
log to verify that the local copy is still the same as the Internet-stored
copy. If not, the local copy and the copy on the server are synchronised.

== A Few Remarks About The User Interface

At the bottom of many Subsurface-mobile screens is a round button that
provides for several actions and which allows the selection of the main
affirmative action (see image above and image below).  On Android devices,
use the Android Back button for "cancel", "discard" or "back" actions. For
example, when editing dive information, tapping the action button saves the
changes, the Android back button can be used to cancel the edit without
saving changes.

image::mobile-images/actionbutton.jpg["FIGURE: Action Button", align="center"]

Instead of the more traditional "hamburger" menu button in the top left or
right corner of the screen to open menus, _Subsurface-mobile_ uses a
different user interaction philosophy based on the Kirigami framework
developed by the Plasma developers. To open the main menu one has three
options:

- Tap on the right-arrow symbol in the lower left corner of the screen (easy
  to reach for hand held devices)
- Swipe towards the right across the left edge of the screen
- Drag the action button visible on most screens with the main action to the
  right

image::mobile-images/menu.jpg["FIGURE: Dive management subpanel", align="center"]

The images above indicate some of the important features of the menu
system.  On the left is the main menu that is activated as described
above. In the middle is the menu that opens if one taps the _GPS_ option on
the main menu. On the right is the menu that opens if one taps the _Manage
Dives_ option on the main menu.

Similarly, the context menu (currently only available on the dive details
screen) can be opened one of these three ways:

- Tap on the left-arrow symbol in the lower right corner of the screen
- Swipe to the left across the right edge of the screen
- Drag the action button to the left

== Viewing the Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives on the
dive list. While the dive list is loading from the cloud, a message appears
at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the cloud is being accessed
(see image on left, below). Once the list is loaded one can scroll up and
down.  Tapping a dive on the list brings up a display of _Details View_ for
that dive (see image on right below).  This includes the dive profile as
well as additional information and notes.

image::mobile-images/divelist.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen", align="center"]

One can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (following dive).

== Editing dive details.

At the bottom of the dive details screen the _Action Button_ contains a
pencil (image on right, above).  Tapping the button brings up a panel with
edit boxes that allows one to change the existing dive information,
e.g. adding text to the dive notes or changing the names or values of some
of the information (see image below).  It may be necessary to scroll the
window to access all the information.  At the bottom of the edit screen is a
_Save_ action button. Tap this to save the new information. Having saved the
data, the dive list screen is updated and shown. To cancel any edits, tap
the Android Back Button.

image::mobile-images/editdive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen", align="center"]

== Adding a new dive to the dive list

It is also possible to add an additional dive to the existing dive list. On
the main menu tap _Manage dives -> Add dive manually_. This opens a screen
that is identical to the editing screen discussed above. When a dive is
added manually, one cannot directly add a dive profile from a dive
computer. However, if one does not use a dive computer, the duration, depth
and several other bits of information about the new dive can be entered. The
_Action button_ at the bottom of the screen contains a disk symbol. Tap this
to save the new dive. To cancel any edits, tap the Android Back Button.  The
left-hand image below shows a screenshot of a dive being created and the
right-hand image shows the same dive in _Details View_.

image::mobile-images/createdive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen", align="center"]

== Deleting a dive

The _details view_ of a dive has a context menu on the right-hand side that
can be activated as described above (e.g. by tapping the arrow icon at the
bottom right of the screen or by dragging the _Action Button_ to the left).
The context menu has a single item: "Delete dive". If this option is tapped,
the dive shown in the _Details View_ is deleted. One has a brief opportunity
to undo the delete by tapping the _undo_ message that appears at the bottom
of the screen. If the _undo_ message is not tapped, the dive is deleted.

== Dive log management

A central  part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive
log using the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.
This provides security against loss or damage to the dive information caintained in a local copy of
the dive log and allows the desktop version of _Subsurface_ to
access changes made using the mobile device. This ability is accessed
throug the main menu (by dragging the Action Button to the right, or
alternatively tap the right angle button at the bottom left of the screen).
 Tap the option _Manage dives_, enabling a number of options:

=== Add new dive manually

This is described above under the section dealing with the dive list.

=== Upload dive log to the _Subsurface_ cloud storage

One can upload the dives contained on the mobile device to the _Subsurface_
cloud storage by tapping the option _Upload to cloud_.  This synchronizes
the local changes to the dive log with the cloud storage.

=== Download dive log from the cloud storage

In the dive management subpanel, tap the option _Refresh_, causing the local
divelog to be refreshed from the cloud so that the cloud and local versions
are synchronised.

=== Changing the login credentials on the _Subsurface_ cloud

It may be necessary to change one's login credentials, for instance if one's
email address (initially used as a credential) has changed. To change the
credentials, open the main menu and tap _Cloud credentials_. This opens the
setup screen for specifying new credentials.


== Recording dive locations using GPS.

The fact that most smartphones have GPS facilities allows one to record the
locations of dives. One can take the smartphone on the dive boat during a
dive and locations will be automatically recorded at regular intervals.
These locations can then be applied to dives in the dive list. Here is how
it's done:

=== Setting up the GPS

Open the main menu and tap _GPS -> Preferences_. Now specify the way in
which GPS data need to be automatically collected (image on right,
below). One can specify that data are collected at regular intervals,
e.g. every 10 minutes, or at regular distances, e.g. after the boat has
moved more than 200m, or a combination of both of the above
approaches. Provide the appropriate information and tap the _Save_ action
button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

image::mobile-images/gpssetup.jpg["FIGURE: GPS setup screen", align="center"]

=== Collecting GPS positions

Ensure that the GPS on the Android device has been activated. At the bottom
of the GPS submenu is a check box _Run location service_ (image on left,
above).  Check this box and _Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS
locations automatically, following the preferences specified as described
above. After the dive one can deactivate the collection of GPS data by
de-activating the same check box at the bottom of the main menu.

=== Storing the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud

Activate the main menu and select the _GPS_ option that brings up the
submenu of GPS-related actions (image on left, above). Tap _Upload GPS data_
that saves the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud server. These GPS data are
saved *separately* from the other dive log data. All collected GPS data are
kept on the Android device, independent of whether they have been uploaded
or not.

=== Downloading GPS data from the _Subsurface_ cloud

Download the GPS data that have been saved on the cloud by selecting
_Download GPS Data_ from the GPS subpanel.

=== Viewing GPS data

From the GPS submenu (image on left, above) select _Show GPS fixes_. This
brings up a list of GPS positions obtained using the location service (image
on left, below). Two actions are possible for each of the locations, enabled
if one taps the handle (the three horisontal stripes on the right, see image
on left, below) and then drags the specific item to the left (image on
right, below). This exposes two options. Tapping the dustbin deletes this
particular GPS location. Tapping the teardrop-shaped icon (actually a Google
Maps pin) opens up Google Maps with a pin indicating the exact map position
of the GPS record being viewed. The two above options can be hidden by
drawing the GPS record to the right, again using the handle.

image::mobile-images/gpsmanagement.jpg["FIGURE: GPS management", align="center"]

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

Assuming that all the dives have been entered into the dive log or have been
downloaded from the _Subsurface_ cloud, one can apply the GPS positions to
these dives. GPS positions can therefore only be applied to dives in the
dive list.  From the GPS subpanel, tap _Apply GPS fixes_. The dive list
contains the start and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_
applies the first GPS position that falls within the dive period of each
dive. This results in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of
the dive list.
