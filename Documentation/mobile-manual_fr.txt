[blue]#_Version 2, juillet 2017_#

Welcome as a user of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging software with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organize, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions, including compatibility with Windows, Mac-OS/X, Linux
(many distributions), Android and iOS. In addition, _Subsurface_ is
open-source software that allows downloading dive information from most dive
computers.

Présentation de Subsurface-mobile
---------------------------------

_Subsurface-mobile_ est une extension de _Subsurface_ qui fonctionne sur les
smartphones Android et iOS et sur les tablettes. C'est un outil pour
visualiser et partager des informations de plongées sur des sites de
plongées où un ordinateur n'est pas utile. _Subsurface-mobile_ permet
également de collecter des positions GPS où sont effectuées les
plongées. (Subsurface-mobile pour iOS ne supporte pas toutes les fonctions
pour le moment).

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows you to enter and save dive information using a
mobile device. Users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the mobile app as
an extension to the laptop/desktop version of _Subsurface_ that allows the
storage of dive logs on the Internet and sharing them between the mobile and
the desktop versions. But _Subsurface-mobile_ can also be used independently
of _Subsurface_ and does not require the use of cloud storage.  While the
desktop version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information for
each dive, the mobile version allows a more accessible dive log on a dive
trip, useful for proving dive experience to dive shops or to review previous
dives.

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows you to:

- Download existing dive log information from the Internet.
- View this information on a mobile device.
- Edit many of the dive log data fields, e.g. divemaster, buddy, equipment or
  notes about a dive.
- Manually create and add new dive records to your dive log.
- Download dive data directly from many dive computers.
- Store the updated dive log in the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.
- Record, store and apply GPS positions of dives (Android only).
- View the localities of recorded GPS positions and of dives on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following text.
_Subsurface-mobile_ does not yet support download of dive data from all the
dive computers that the desktop/laptop version can: that still needs to be
done using _Subsurface_ on a desktop or laptop computer. Only a subset of
dive computers that use a FTDI USB interface or a Bluetooth/BTLE interface
are accessible by _Subsurface-mobile_.

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on your mobile device

Find _Subsurface-mobile_ in the _Google Play Store_ or the _iTunes Store_
and install it.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

Upon starting _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a Subsurface splash
screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this may take
several seconds. After loading, the _Cloud Credentials screen_ appears (see
image below on left).

Select whether _Subsurface-mobile_ should access the Internet for dive log
information as follows:

=== When NOT Using Cloud Storage
Tap the striked-out cloud icon. The app will not access the _Subsurface_
cloud storage server to obtain dive log information. This means that dive
log information is stored on the mobile device only.

=== Using Cloud Storage
In order to use the _Subsurface_ cloud storage, an account on the cloud
server is required. If you have already set up an account from the
_Subsurface_ desktop application, enter the credentials here.

You can also create a new cloud storage account from your mobile device.

==== Using the desktop version of _Subsurface_:

Open the desktop version of _Subsurface_ and
click _File   ->  Preferences  -> Network_, explained in detail in the
https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/subsurface-4-user-manual/#\_create_a_cloud_storage_account[user
manual for the _Subsurface_ desktop version]. Once the account has
been created and verified using the desktop version,
_Subsurface_ desktop alows you to download dive information from dive computers and store this
on the cloud which can, in turn, be downloaded to _Subsurface-mobile_. _Subsurface-mobile_
attempts to download the existing dive log from the _Subsurface_ cloud
server. Appropriate messages are shown onscreen. Finally a list of dives is shown.

Once the dive list has been downloaded from the Internet,
_Subsurface-mobile_ keeps a local copy on the mobile device. This means that
even if there is no Internet connection at a dive site, you can still access
the local copy and view and manipulate dive information. If there is
Internet connectivity, _Subsurface-mobile_ accesses the cloud-based dive log
to verify that the local copy is still the same as the Internet-stored
copy. If not, the local copy and the copy on the server are synchronised.


image::mobile-images/Credentials.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile landing screen", align="center"]


==== Using _Subsurface-mobile_:

Enter an e-mail address and a password in the fields indicated on the
screen.  The e-mail should be in lower case and the password should contain
a combination of letters from the alphabet (upper and lower case) and/or
numbers. When entering a password, it is possible to check a checkbox that
enables the text of the password to be shown (image on left, above). At this
stage, the red message "Cannot connect to cloud storage" appears on the
screen.  This is normal because a valid PIN has not yet been provided (image
on left, above).

Tap the Disk (Save) icon at the bottom of the screen. A PIN is sent to the
e-mail address provided.

Enter the PIN into the field indicated and tap the _Save_ icon again. The
user information is stored on the cloud server and access to the cloud is
enabled.

The dive list is initially empty. Start entering dives in the dive log or
download dive information from either a _Subsurface_ cloud storage account
or from a dive computer.


== Menu Structure and User Interface

At the bottom of many Subsurface-mobile screens is a round button that
provides for several actions and which allows the selection of the main
affirmative action (see image above and image below).  On Android devices,
use the Android Back button for "cancel", "discard" or "back" actions. For
example, when editing dive information, tapping the action button saves the
changes while the Android back button can be used to cancel the edit without
saving changes.

On iOS devices, on screens where a "back" action is enabled, a back arrow is
shown in the top left corner of the screen.

image::mobile-images/actionbutton.jpg["FIGURE: Action Button", align="center"]

In order to have a consistent experience between iOS and Android,
_Subsurface-mobile_ on Android does not use the traditional "hamburger" menu
button in the top left or right corner of the screen to open menus.
Instead, _Subsurface-mobile_ uses a different user interaction philosophy
based on the Kirigami framework developed by the Plasma developers. There
are three ways to open the main menu:

- Tap the "hamburger" symbol in the lower left corner of the screen (easy to
  reach for hand held devices)
- Swipe towards the right across the left edge of the screen
- Drag the action button visible on most screens to the right

image::mobile-images/MainMenu2.jpg["FIGURE: Dive management subpanel", align="center"]

The images above indicate some of the important features of the menu
system.  On the left is the main menu, activated as described above. On the
right, above, is a representation of the menu items of all the submenus
accessible from the main menu: the main menu items are shown on the left
while the submenu contents are shown on a blue background on the right.

All screenshots in this user manual are currently from the Android
version. As indicated earlier, the iOS version currently doesn't support
_GPS_ features.

== Viewing the Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives on the
dive list. While the dive list is loading from the cloud, a message appears
at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the cloud is being
accessed. Once the list is loaded you can scroll up and down.  Tapping a
dive on the list brings up a display of _Details View_ for that dive (see
image on right below). This includes the dive profile as well as additional
information and notes.

image::mobile-images/DiveList.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen", align="center"]

You can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (following dive).  Using the Action Bar, it is
also possible to delete the dive (tap the dustbin on the Action Bar) or to
view the dive location on a map viewer (Google Maps on Android, the Google
Maps web site on iOS; tap the GPS icon on the Action Bar.).

[[S_Edit_Dive]]
== Editing dive details

At the bottom of the dive details screen the _Action Button_ contains a
pencil (image on right, above).  Tapping the pencil button brings up a panel
with edit boxes that allows you to change the existing dive information,
e.g. adding text to the dive notes or changing the names or values of some
of the information (see image below).  It may be necessary to scroll the
window to access all the information.  At the bottom of the edit screen is a
_Save_ action button. Tap this to save the new information. Having saved the
data, the dive list screen is updated and shown. To cancel any edits, tap
the Android Back Button or swipe the edit screen up (fling it away).

image::mobile-images/EditDive.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen", align="center"]

[[S_Add_Dive]]
== Adding a new dive to the dive list

You can manually add a dive to the existing dive list. On the dive list tap
the "plus" sign in the _Action Button_, or use the main menu and tap _Manage
dives -> Add dive manually_. This opens a screen that is identical to the
editing screen discussed above. When a dive is added manually, you cannot
directly add a dive profile from a dive computer. However, if you do not use
a dive computer, the duration, depth and several other bits of information
about the new dive can be entered. The _Action button_ at the bottom of the
screen contains a disk symbol. Tap this to save the new dive. To cancel any
edits, tap the Android Back Button.  The left-hand image below shows a
screenshot of a dive being created and the right-hand image shows the same
dive in _Details View_.

image::mobile-images/ManuallyEnterDive.jpg["FIGURE: Manual dive entry screen", align="center"]

== Deleting a dive

The _Details View_ of a dive has an Action Bar, including a dustbin. If this
is tapped, the dive shown in the _Details View_ is deleted. You have a brief
opportunity to undo the delete by tapping the grey _Undo_ button in the
message that appears at the bottom of the screen (see image below).

image::mobile-images/Delete_undo.jpg["FIGURE: Undo delete dive", align="center"]

You can also delete a dive from the dive list by long-pressing a specific
dive until a red dustbin appears on the right-hand side (see image
below). Tap the dustbin. The dive is deleted without asking any confirmation
because _Subsurface-mobile_ assumes that the combination of a long tap on
the dive with another tap on the red dustbin is an unambiguous instruction
to delete the dive.

image::mobile-images/RedDustbin.jpg["FIGURE: delete dive from list", align="center"]

== Download dives from a dive computer

Download of dives is possible from dive computers with a FTDI USB interface,
or with a Bluetooth interface.

First, establish a link between the dive computer and the mobile device.

For USB dive computers, USB cables "normally" used for uploading dives to a
desktop/laptop computer do NOT work: these cables often have a full-sized
male USB plug on one end which plugs into the USB port of a desktop/laptop
computer. For downloads to a mobile device one needs a USB OTG (USB
On-The-Go) cable. In most cases it is required to plug the USB cable
"normally" used with the dive computer into a USB OTG cable which, in turn,
plugs into the mini-USB receptacle of the mobile device. The OTG cable often
has a full-size female receptacle at one end which accommodates the
full-sized male plug of the USB cable "normally" used (see image
below). This means that two cables are used to connect the dive computer to
the mobile device.

image::mobile-images/USB-OTG.jpg["FIGURE: USB-OTG cable", align="center"]

For Bluetooth-equipped dive computers, establish a Bluetooth connection
between the dive computer and the mobile device. Use the tools on the mobile
device to achieve this. For of Android mobile devices, the Settings ->
Bluetooth tool is probably appropriate. Ensure pairing of the dive computer
and mobile device.  _Subsurface-mobile_ performs communication using both
Bluetooth and Bluetooth-low-energy (BTLE).  The appropriate choice of
Bluetooth communication is made by the software and the user need not be
concerned with this.

With propper communication between dive computer and _Subsurface-mobile_
having been set up, dive download is simple.  From the main menu, tap
_Manage dives -> Download from DC_. A screen is shown requiring that the
user specify the names of the vendor and model of the dive computer. For
instance, when using a Shearwater Petrel 2 dive computer, the vendor is
_Shearwater_ and the Dive computer name is _Petrel 2_. From the two dropdown
lists at the top of the screen, select the correct vendor and dive computer
names (see image on the left, below). If using a dive computer using a
Bluetooth connection, then tap the check box labelled _Bluetooth download_.

Now tap the button labled _DOWNLOAD_. The downloaded dives appear in the
bottom part of the screen, the most recent dive at the top (see image on
right, below). Be patient because the download can sometimes take a few
mimnutes.  Each dive has a check-box on the left hand side, used for
selecting which dives need to be added to the _Subsurface-mobile_ dive list:
dives that are not checked are ignored. With the appropriate downloaded
dives having been checked, tap the button at the bottom left labled
_ACCEPT_. All the selected dives appear on the _Subsurface-mobile_ dive
list. The downloaded dive information can now be edited as described in the
section above xref:S_Edit_Dive[Edit a dive].

image::mobile-images/DC-Download.jpg["FIGURE: DC download screen", align="center"]

== Viewing the dive location on Google Maps

The site of a specific dive can be viewed in two ways using the _Details
View_.  The Action Bar at the bottom has a GPS pin on the left hand
side. Tap that pin and the dive site is shown in Google Maps. Close Google
Maps by using the Android _Back_ button.

Alternatively, the _Details View_ has a button at the top right hand marked
_Map it_. Tap this button to open Google Maps showing the dive site.

image::mobile-images/Map.jpg["FIGURE: Map of dive site", align="center"]

== Dive log management

A central part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive log
using the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.  This provides security against loss
or damage to the dive information contained in a local copy of the dive log
and allows the desktop version of _Subsurface_ to access changes made using
the mobile device. This ability is accessed through the main menu (by
dragging the Action Button to the right, or alternatively tapping the
"Hamburger" icon at the bottom left of the screen).  Tap the option _Manage
dives_, enabling a number of options:

=== Add new dive manually

This is described above under the section dealing with
xref:S_Add_Dive[Adding a new dive to the dive list].

=== Sync the dive log with the _Subsurface_ cloud storage

Upload the dives contained on the mobile device to the _Subsurface_ cloud
storage by tapping the option _Manual sync with cloud_.  This synchronizes
the local changes to the dive log with the cloud storage. It also downloads
changes made to the dive log using another device or computer and stored in
cloud storage.

=== Working offline or online

By default _Subsurface-mobile_ runs offline and only syncs the dive list
with cloud storage when explicily told to do so (see above).  You can choose
to always sync with the cloud servers after every modification of the dive
list. This is not recommended unless you are in an area with fast and
reliable internet connection, as otherwise _Subsurface-mobile_ might appear
to hang between operations as it tries to connect to the cloud server.

=== Changing the login credentials on the _Subsurface_ cloud

The login credentials (for example to work with multiple accounts) can be
changed by opening the main menu and by tapping _Settings -> Cloud
credentials_. This opens the screen for specifying new credentials.

=== Changing the colour scheme of _Subsurface-mobile_

_Subsurface-mobile_ has three colour schemes to please users with different
tastes. This user manual shows the default colour scheme, comprising blue
colours. Change to a pink or a dark colour scheme by opening the main menu
and tap Settings -> Preferences. This opens the Preferences screen that
includes the three colour schemes (see image below).

image::mobile-images/ColourSchemes.jpg["FIGURE: Colour scheme setup screen", align="center"]

== Recording dive locations using GPS (Android only).

The fact that most smartphones have GPS facilities allows
_Subsurface-mobile_ on Android to record the locations of dives. You can
take the smartphone on the dive boat during a dive and locations will be
automatically recorded at regular intervals.  These locations can then be
applied to dives in the dive list. Here is how it's done:

=== Setting up the GPS

Open the main menu and tap _GPS -> Preferences_. Now specify the way in
which GPS data need to be automatically collected (image above). Data are
collected at regular intervals, e.g. every 5 minutes, or at regular
distances, e.g. after the boat has moved more than 200m, or a combination of
both of these approaches. Provide the appropriate information and tap the
_Save_ action button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

=== Collecting GPS positions

image::mobile-images/Mainmenu.jpg["FIGURE: Main menu", align="center"]

Ensure that the GPS on the Android device has been activated. At the bottom
of the GPS submenu is a check box _Run location service_ (image above).
Check this box and _Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS locations
automatically, following the preferences specified as described above. After
return from the dive trip you can deactivate the collection of GPS data by
de-activating the same check box at the bottom of the main menu.

=== Storing the GPS data on the _Subsurface_ cloud

Activate the main menu and select the _GPS_ option that brings up the
submenu of GPS-related actions. Tap _Upload GPS data_ that saves the GPS
data on the _Subsurface_ cloud server. These GPS data are saved *separately*
from the other dive log data. All collected GPS data are kept on the Android
device, independent of whether they have been uploaded or not.

=== Downloading GPS data from the _Subsurface_ cloud

Download the GPS data that have been saved on the cloud (possibly by a
different device) by selecting _Download GPS Data_ from the GPS subpanel.

=== Viewing GPS data

From the GPS submenu select _Show GPS fixes_. This brings up a list of GPS
positions obtained using the location service (image on left, below). Two
actions are possible for each of the locations, enabled if you tap the
handle (the three horisontal stripes on the right, see image on left, below)
and then drags the specific item to the left (image on right, below). This
exposes two options. Tapping the dustbin deletes this particular GPS
location. Tapping the teardrop-shaped icon (actually a Google Maps pin)
opens up Google Maps with a pin indicating the exact map position of the GPS
record being viewed. The two above options can be hidden by drawing the GPS
record to the right, again using the handle.

image::mobile-images/gpsmanagement.jpg["FIGURE: GPS management", align="center"]

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

Assuming that all the dives have been entered into the dive log or have been
downloaded from the _Subsurface_ cloud, you can apply the GPS positions to
these dives. GPS positions can therefore only be applied to dives in the
dive list.  From the GPS subpanel, tap _GPS-tag dives_. The dive list
contains the start and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_
applies the first GPS position that falls within the dive period of each
dive. This results in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of
the dive log.
