This is the README file for Subsurface master towards 4.5

Please check the ReleaseNotes.txt for details about new features and
changes since Subsurface 4.4.2 (and earlier versions).

Subsurface can be found at http://subsurface-divelog.org

Our user forum is at http://subsurface-divelog.org/user-forum/
We also try to respond to questions in the ScubaBoard.com dive software
forum at http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/dive-software/

You can get the sources to the latest development version from the git
repository:

git clone git://git.subsurface-divelog.org/subsurface.git .

You can also browse the sources via gitweb at the same site.

If you want the latest release (instead of the bleeding edge
development version) you can either get this via git or the release tar
ball. After cloning run the following command:

git checkout v4.4.2  (or whatever the last release is)

or download a tar ball from:

http://subsurface-divelog.org/downloads/Subsurface-4.4.2.tgz

Detailed build instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

Basic Usage:
============

Install and start from the desktop, or you can run it locally from the
build directory:

On Linux:

$ ./subsurface

On Mac:

$ open Subsurface.app

Native builds on Windows are not really supported (the official Windows
installers are both cross-built on Linux).

You can give a data file as command line argument, or (once you have
set this up in the Preferences) Subsurface picks a default file for
you when started from the desktop or without an argument.

If you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer, you can just
select "Import from Divecomputer" from the "Import" menu, select which
dive computer you have (and where it is connected if you need to), and
hit "OK".

The latest list of supported dive computers can be found in the file
SupportedDivecomputers.txt.

Much more detailed end user instructions can be found from inside
Subsurface by selecting Help (typically F1). When building from source
this is also available as Documentation/user-manual.html. The
documentation for the latest release is also available on-line
http://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/


Contributing:
=============

There is a mailing list for developers: subsurface@subsurface-divelog.org
Go to http://lists.subsurface-divelog.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/subsurface
to subscribe.

If you want to contribute code, please either send signed-off patches or
a pull request with signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them,
we will not accept them. This means adding a line that says
"Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of each commit, indicating that
you wrote the code and have the right to pass it on as an open source
patch.

See: http://developercertificate.org/

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative)

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what you're
	doing, as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers and your
	future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a
	particular solution was implemented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation. Please use verbs in the
imperative in the commit message, as in "Fix bug that...", "Add
file/feature ...", or "Make Subsurface..."


A bit of Subsurface history:
============================

In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him an
opportunity to start on a new endeavor, Linus Torvalds decided to tackle
his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.

Subsurface is the result of the work of him and a team of developers since
then. It now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from
a large number of dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It
provides advanced visualization of the key information provided by a
modern dive computer and allows the user to track a wide variety of data
about their diving.

In fall of 2012 Dirk Hohndel took over as maintainer of Subsurface.
