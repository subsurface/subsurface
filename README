Subsurface - an Open Source Divelog
===================================

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

With Subsurface the user can download dive information directly from a
large number of supported dive computers. Subsurface is able to track
single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It displays
a dive profile with all related information including air consumption
and alarms. It also allows logging of information like weights and
exposure protection used, dive masters and dive buddies and enables
the user to rate dives and provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including
dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized
in more than a dozen languages and well supported by an active
developer community.

One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range
of dive computers (most common dive computers are supported, a
detailed list is at
http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/supported-dive-computers).
Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from several sources
including MacDive, Suunto DM3, JDiveLog and divelogs.de. Another
strength is its ability to visualize the depth profile (and, if
available, the tank pressure curve) in very innovative ways that give
the user additional information on relative velocity (and momentary
air consumption) during the dive through the coloring of the graphs.

The latest public version is Subsurface 3.0, released in February of 2013.

You can get the latest sources from the git repository:

git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

or

git clone http://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

You can also browse the sources via gitweb.


Building subsurface under Linux
-------------------------------
You need libxml2-devel, libxslt-devel, gtk2-devel, glib-2.0,
gconf2-devel, libsoup-devel to build this (and libusb-1.0 if you have
libdivecomputer built with it, but then you obviously already have it
installed). Check with your Linux distribution how to install these
packages.

On Debian the package names are different; try libxml2-dev,
libgtk2.0-dev, libglib2.0-dev, libgconf2-dev, libsoup2.4-dev,
libxslt1-dev, zlib1g-dev. It seems the cairo packages at least in
Squeeze is too old.

To be able to visualise the dives on a map (optional), using GPS
coordinates, install the osm-gps-map-devel (Fedora) or libosmgpsmap-dev
(Debian) package. That will be detected and configured at build
time. The library is used to embed maps in applications that, when
given GPS co-ordinates, draw a GPS track.

You also need to have libdivecomputer installed. The current git
versions of Subsurface assume that you use libdivecomputer version
0.3, which goes something like this:

git clone \
git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
cd libdivecomputer
git checkout release-0.3
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install

NOTE! Sometimes you may need to tell the main Subsurface Makefile where
you installed libdivecomputer; pkg-config for libdivecomputer doesn't
always work unless the project has been installed by the distro.

Just edit the makefile directly.


Building Subsurface under Windows
---------------------------------
Subsurface builds nicely with MinGW - the official builds are done as
cross builds under Linux (currently on Fedora 17). A shell script to do
that (plus the .nsi file to create the installer with makensis) are
included in the packaging/Windows directory.

The best way to get libdivecomputer to build appears to be

mingw32-configure
mingw32-make
sudo mingw32-make install

Once you have built and installed libdivecomputer you can use

sh packaging/Windows/mingw-make.sh

to then build subsurface. In order to create an installer simply use

sh packaging/Windows/mingw-make.sh create-windows-installer


Building subsurface on a Mac
----------------------------
Install MacPorts and install the dependencies from MacPorts:
sudo port install gtk2 +quartz py27-pygtk +quartz libusb gtk-osx-application \
     automake autoconf libtool libsoup osm-gps-map libzip

Install libdivecomputer:
git clone git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
cd libdivecomputer
autoreconf --install
LIBUSB_CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure
make
sudo make install

Install subsurface:
git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
cd subsurface
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/" make
sudo make install-macosx

More instructions on how to create a Subsurface DMG can be found in
packaging/macosx/README


Usage:
======

Install and start from the desktop (or you can run it locally from the
build directory).

./subsurface

You can give a data file as command line argument, or Subsurface picks a
default file for you when started from the desktop or without an argument.

If you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer, you can just
select "Download from Divecomputer" from the Log menu, tell it what dive
computer you have (and where it is connected if you need to), and hit
"OK".

Contributing:
-------------

There is a mailing list for developers: subsurface@hohndel.org
Go to http://lists.hohndel.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/subsurface
to subscribe.

If you want to contribute code, please either send signed-off patches or
a pull request with signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them,
we will not accept them. This means adding a line that says
"Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of each commit, indicating that
you wrote the code and have the right to pass it on as an open source
patch.

See: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.

A bit of Subsurface history:
----------------------------

In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him an
opportunity to start on a new endeavor, Linus Torvalds decided to tackle
his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.

Subsurface is the result of the work of him and a team of developers since
then. It now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from
a large number of dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It
provides advanced visualization of the key information provided by a
modern dive computer and allows the user to track a wide variety of data
about their diving.
